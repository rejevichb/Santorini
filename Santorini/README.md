This directory contains code related to the Santorini game.

This directory is composed of multiple sub-directories:
 * the `Admin` directory houses administrator-specific code
 * the `Player` directory houses player-specific code
 * the `Common` directory contains code that both the administrative and player components need
 * the `Lib` directory contains all library-like code

Please run `./TESTME` to execute all unit tests
