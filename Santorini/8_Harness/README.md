This directory contains all of the test cases, code and executables related to 
our testing infrastructure for our strategy implementation. 

The executable `xstrategy` can be used to run the testing harness.

The code related to parsing test inputs can be found in the Aux subdirectory.

The test cases are located in distinct files in the strategy-tests directory.
