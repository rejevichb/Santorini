# Santorini Test Harness

Project 10's deliverable is the `xobserve` test harness meant to showcase a JSON-printing observer to a single game between two AI strategies.

The implementation of Santorini's observer interface can be found in `Santorini/Common/observer.go`.

To run tests against our `xobserve` implementation:
```./TESTME```
