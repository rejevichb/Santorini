# Santorini Test Harness

Project 8's deliverable is the `xstrategy` test harness meant to handle move determination for Strategies given boardstates and moves.

The implementation of Santorini's strategy can be found in `Santorini/Player`, the folder adjacent to this one (`8`).

`strategy-tests/` contains the `.json` files representing sample player inputs (`n-in.json`) and outputs (`n-out.json`) that can be fed into `xstrategy` to simulate player actions during a game, and the respective outputs.

To run tests against our `xstrategy` implementation:
```./TESTME```
